## Issues 👮

#### Creating an issue 📝

- There are different types in the issues section such as `Bug` , `Documentation` , `Feature` . You can choose, or create any of the types of issues.
- In case you need to create something else, you can use the `Other` type. Blank issues are not recommended at all.
- When creating an issue make sure you fill up the fields properly and also make sure that you are **not raising a duplicate issue.**
- The `labels` are used to categorize the issues and they will be automatically added based on the type of issue you are creating.

#### Working on an Issue 🛠️

- Only ask to be assigned 1 issue at a time.
- **Do not** enable GitHub Actions on your fork
- You can assign yourself to an issue if you want to work on it by checking the `I am willing to work on this issue (blank for no)` checkbox.
- In case someone else has left that box empty, you can assign yourself to that issue by commenting `I would like to work on this issue` on that issue.
- We assign on a **first come first serve basis**.


#### Closing an Issue 📌

- If you are the one who has created the issue and want to close it you can close it by yourself.
- If you are working on the issue, you can reference the issue in the pull request in `closes #issue_number` format & the issue will be closed automatically when the PR is merged.
